What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I had to implement a data structure to fulfill reuiremnets of a fake client. Some tasks I needed to implement involved creating a menu and prompting the user based on different scenarios.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To tackle this problem, understanding and properly implementing data structures was crucial. This is important because I had to understand the purpose of various data structures and trade offs involved in each data structure in order to choose the best option for my use case. I researched the pros and cons of potential data structures, and examined the ways that each data structure could help me approach my tasks in the most optimal way. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I referred to documentation explaining more about data structures as needed, and researched what the majority of people online suggested as best practice for choosing specific data structures for various scenarios. Reading articles discussed in the course material was also a valuable resource. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Before this project, my approach to software design was more simplistic. But working on this project, with its many interacting components, has made me realize the importance of carefully designing system architecture and breaking tasks into smaller parts but also considering if they can fit together to accompish the end goal of the program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Through this project, I have focused more on implementing clean, maintainable code. I've adopted practices like adding a lot of comments, using consistent naming conventions, and keeping functions small and specific so they are adaptable and readable.
